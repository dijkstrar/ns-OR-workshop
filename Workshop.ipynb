    "For this formulation we may use the trick that whenever $x=0$ we cannot produce any e-bikes, and we thus require $y_{\\text{e-bike}}\\leq 0*15$. However, if we are allowed to produce e-bikes, $x=1$, we can produce a limited quantity of 15, yielding $y_{\\text{e-bike}}\\leq 1*15$ as a constraint. With this logic in mind, we can force the model to make a choice on the value of $x$ by including the effect of $x$ in the objective function, namely a decrease in revenue of 30,000 if we decide to incur the R&D costs.\n",
