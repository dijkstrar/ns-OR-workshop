# OR Workshop at NS

Welcome to the Operations Research (OR) workshop hosted by me! This repository contains the materials for the workshop, including a Jupyter notebook for interactive learning and exercises.

# Workshop Notebook
The primary resource for this workshop is the Workshop.ipynb notebook. In order to run the notebook, attendees must have experience with running devcontainers. This requires Docker, VS Code, and WSL for Windows devices. To run the notebook, attendees need to build the devcontainer and open the `Workshop.ipynb` file.
If attendees do not have the necessary requirements to run devcontainers, they can resort to using platforms like Databricks or Google Colab for running the workshop materials.

# Getting Started
To start the workshop, attendees can open the `Workshop.ipynb` file and begin reading the contents and doing the exercises. Ensure that the devcontainer is set up as per the provided requirements.
Alternative Options

We're excited to have you join us for the OR workshop! Happy learning and problem-solving! ðŸš€
